---

Quickstart â€” Backend

1. 


Clone repository



	git clone https://github.com/yourorg/lab-management.git
	cd lab-management



2. 
Configure appsettings.json (example)



	{
	  "MongoDbSettings": {
	    "ConnectionString": "mongodb://localhost:27017",
	    "DatabaseName": "LabManagementDb"
	  },
	  "JwtSettings": {
	    "SecretKey": "replace_with_a_long_random_secret",
	    "Issuer": "LabManagementAPI",
	    "Audience": "LabManagementClient",
	    "ExpiryMinutes": 1440
	  },
	  "AllowedHosts": "*"
	}


	- Use environment variables or user secrets in development; never commit secrets.
3. 
Restore & build



	dotnet restore
	dotnet build



4. 
Run



	dotnet run


	- API will be available at http://localhost:5036 (or port shown in logs).
	- Swagger: http://localhost:5036/swagger

---

Quickstart â€” Frontend (development)

1. From frontend directory:

	cd web   # adjust path to your React app
	npm install
	npm run dev



2. For production build:

	npm run build
	# copy the build output to backend/wwwroot or configure deployment pipeline

Configuration Notes

- api client (frontend) uses request(path, opts) and relative URLs by default (.e.g request('/api/labs')). You may switch to a named BASE_HOST variable if deploying frontend and backend on different hosts.
- See src/api.js for all frontend routes and defensive checks (e.g. getSubmissions/labId validation, getMySubmission for students).

Notifications â€” how they work

- On lab creation:
	- Backend looks up subject name (via SubjectService) and enrolled students (User.SubjectIds).
	- Creates per-student Notification documents; if no students found, creates a broadcast Notification.
- Background worker (LabReminderBackgroundService):
	- Periodically checks labs and creates:
		- "Starting soon" reminder (configurable minutes before start)
		- "Lab ended" notification when end time passes
	- Uses NotificationService.ExistsAsync(...) to avoid duplicates.
- Frontend polls GET /api/notifications and displays unread counts in Navbar; clicking a notification marks it read and navigates to the relevant entity.

---

File storage (uploads/downloads)

- Submission files stored by FileHelper (server):
	- SaveFileAsync(IFormFile) â€” saves to server storage (e.g. wwwroot/uploads) and returns a file URL
	- DeleteFile(fileUrl) â€” deletes file from storage
	- GetFileStream(fileUrl) â€” returns stream for download endpoint
- Download endpoint streams file with proper Authorization checks.

---

Security & Best Practices

- Server-side authorization is authoritative. Keep [Authorize(Roles = "Teacher")] on grading endpoints.
- Use environment secrets for JWT keys and DB connection strings in production.
- Limit upload size and types in controllers (RequestFormLimits and size checks).
- Sanitize user inputs and validate DTOs (e.g., CreateLabDto validation).
- Use HTTPS in production and configure proper CORS policies.

---

Development tips & suggestions (improvements)

- Add SignalR for real-time notifications (removes polling).
- Add email/SMS notification delivery pipeline (use Notification documents as queue).
- Add a searchable/paginated notifications endpoint and a notifications center UI.
- Add admin UI for subject management and student enrollment (useful for per-subject notifications).
- Add audit logging and monitoring (Serilog + Seq / ELK).
- Add E2E tests for critical flows (login, create lab, submit, grade).
- Add role management UI and multi-tenant features if needed.

---

Troubleshooting

- If notifications collection is empty after creating labs:
	- Ensure logged-in teacher is creating lab
	- Ensure students have SubjectIds containing created subject id (otherwise broadcast created instead)
	- Check backend logs for exceptions from NotificationService
- If attendance endpoints 500:
	- Confirm Lab documents are not malformed (use ReplaceOneAsync for updates)
	- Check timezone handling when comparing UTC dates (server uses UTC in checks)
- If frontend requests /api/... return 404/500:
	- Verify backend is running and CORS configured for frontend origin
	- Verify JWT token present in localStorage (key token) for protected endpoints
